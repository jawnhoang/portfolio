  <h5>Academic Journey In A Nutshell</h5>
  </center>
  <p class = "para">During my childhood I spent most my time playing with LEGO. This became the foundation of my interests in computer science and software engineering.</b>
      I've been looking at code as tiny LEGO bricks that fit together and forms something bigger. Coding to me is basically playing with an endless supply of digital building blocks.
  </p>
  <p class = "para">At SJSU, I primarily learned Java, with Python as my secondary language. I am always trying to improve my programming skills through various 
    websites like LeetCode and HackerRank. I'm always open towards feedback and constructed criticism when it comes to code. The community is vast 
    and offers more than I can ever expect.
